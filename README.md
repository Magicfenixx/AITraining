1.1	Objective: 

The objective of this project is to investigate how various factors of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as complexity, type, source, training time, and size, influence the accuracy of image classification tasks. The study aims to provide insights into optimizing these factors to enhance model performance.

1.2	Scope:

Data Acquisition: Utilize the Web resourses such as paperswithcode to collect data on the relevant field, such as:  Datasets focusing on metrics such as popularity scores and viewer ratings.

Data Processing: Implement a data engineering pipeline to clean, preprocess, and structure the dataset for analysis.

Data Storage: Employ appropriate storage technologies to manage the streaming or batch data efficiently.

Analytical Model: Develop regression models (linear and polynomial) to analyze the data and extract insights into the correlation between movie popularity and ratings.
